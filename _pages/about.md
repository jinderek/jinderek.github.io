I‚Äôm a Senior Software Engineer at Ant Group, where I focus on large-scale graph computing and graph learning frameworks. I hold a Master‚Äôs and Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Electrical Engineering and Electronic Information Engineering from Zhejiang University.

In 2021, I received the FY2021 Excellent Engineer - Most Innovative Spirit Award at Ant Group for my work on AI infrastructure and high-performance computing. I‚Äôve published papers in PACT and ACM TACO, and given talks at conferences like Stanford DAWN and GTC. I‚Äôm a strong team player with leadership and communication skills.

My main interests include Machine Learning Systems, Parallel Computing, GPU Computing, Graph Learning, and Compiler Optimization. I‚Äôm particularly focused on AI systems and GPU technologies and always excited to collaborate‚Äîfeel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!
