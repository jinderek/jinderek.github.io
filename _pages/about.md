<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a senior software engineer at Ant Group in Hangzhou, China, focusing on large-scale graph computing and learning. 

I hold both a bachelor's and a master's degree in Electronic Information Engineering from Zhejiang University.

My research interests encompass parallel computing, compilers, deep learning, and graph learning.
