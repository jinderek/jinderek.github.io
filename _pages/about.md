<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at Ant Group, specializing in large-scale graph computing and graph learning frameworks.

I hold both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Electronic Information Engineering and Electric Engineering from Zhejiang University.

In 2021, I received the FY2021 Excellent Engineer - Most Innovative Spirit Award at Ant Group, in recognition of my contributions to AI infrastructure and high-performance computing.

I have published papers as the first author at PACT and EuroSys, and have delivered talks at conferences such as Stanford DAWN and GTC. I also have strong skills in teamwork, leadership, and communication.

My research interests include Machine Learning Systems, Parallel Computing, High-Performance Computing, GPUs, and Compiler Optimization.

I am currently particularly interested in AI systems, high-performance computing, and GPUs, and I am eager to collaborate on research in these areas. Please feel free to reach out!
